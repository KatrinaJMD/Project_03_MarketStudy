# Project_03_MarketStudy
### <b>ABOUT</b>
A food industry-based company specializing in chicken wants to expand its business internationally.

The goal of this project is to help target prospective countries. The company's strategy is to export its products to those countries rather than let them produce locally.

### <b>SKILLS ASSESSED</b>
- Interpret a PCA analysis
- Construct and read a dendrogram
- Test the adequacy of a law by a statistical test

### <b>CONDITIONS</b>
It is required to master data manipulation in Python to carry out this project and apply descriptive statistics and automatic classification.

### <b>DATA</b>
The data used for this project are found on the [FAO](http://www.fao.org/faostat/fr/#data) website. If you want to follow along with this project, it will be up to you to find the most relevant data useful for the analysis.

# MISSION
It is needed to study the diets of each country, especially in terms of animal protein and calories.

### Mission n°1
A sample was built in order to conduct an analysis. The model will have a list of all the countries in the world characterized by the following information:
- Population percentage difference between a previous year (optional) and the current year
- Animal protein ratio compared to the total amount of protein in the country's food supply
- Food availability in proteins per capita
- Food availability in calories per capita

### Mission n°2
Built a dendrogram with all the countries on the sample and clustered into 5 groups.

### Mission n°3
Add valuable and relevant information to the data (i.e., GDP per capita). Characterize each group based on the available variables in the data. 

### Mission n°4
A short list of targeted countries with their characteristics.

### Mission n°5
Visualization of groups in the first factorial plane by employing ACP analysis.

### Mission n°6
Verify if the groups truly differ by performing the following statistical tests:

- Adequacy test: among the 4 variables or other relevant variables. This phase looks for a normally distributed variable
- Comparison test of two populations/clusters (in the Gaussian case): testing the Gaussian variable
